# Workflows
This repository houses reusable workflows tailored for the Newfold organization, specifically designed for tasks such as testing module changes within a plugin from a module pull request (PR). These workflows that must be referenced from a "caller" workflow within the repository, and they come with required inputs. For more details on workflows and reusable workflows, refer to [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

Currently, we are utilizing the `@main` ref, but the option to tag a `@v1` version exists for these workflows, allowing updates across the organization if the need arises.

## Wiki Docs
